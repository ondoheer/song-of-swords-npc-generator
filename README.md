# Song of Swords NPC Generator

This is a terminal based NPC generator for quickly developing characters for our campaigns.

_It is badly, tightly coupled written code._

## Characteristics

- It **only** creates new characters
- It **does not** imrpove characters with arc points
- It only generates **humans** and **dwarves** because that is all we use in out campaign
- It **does not** build characters that use firearms but can easily be configured to do so
- I have defined some basic **lifestyles** so the skill assignment makes sense. The skill packets weren't good enough to create full characters
- It won't buy extra boons if the Boons and Banes PCP value is negative or 0
- It **does not** select talents or superior maneuvers **YET**
- It chooses a campaign power randomly because **I want it this way** to simulate different character _levels_
- It **does not** choose equipment **YET**
- It allows you to add a background story to a generated character so you can use it as it is
